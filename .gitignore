## 📝 .gitkeep Files

Create empty `.gitkeep` files in:

**data/.gitkeep:**
```
# This file ensures the data/ directory is tracked by git
# The actual CSV files will be ignored but the folder structure is preserved
```

**assets/.gitkeep:**
```
# This file ensures the assets/ directory is tracked by git
# Add your screenshots here for README.md
```
